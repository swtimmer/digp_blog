# Data Insights Global Practice MSDN blog

In this Git repository I will place code that has been used in blog posts that I write for my team's blog at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/data_insights_global_practice/. My work evolves mostly around implementations that utilize the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://studio.azureml.net/Home), hence you will find most of my blog posts and code (R or Python) being on that topic. 

## Current blog posts:
